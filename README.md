# MyProject

This project performs real-time image processing and background median calculation using OpenCV. It also utilizes OpenMP for parallel processing.

## Features

- Capture real-time video stream
- Grayscale image processing
- Median background modeling
- Motion detection
- Parallel processing with OpenMP

## Installation

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install OpenCV and OpenMP libraries.
   - For OpenCV installation, follow the [OpenCV official documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html).
   - OpenMP is usually included with modern C++ compilers (such as g++ or clang).

2. Clone the project repository and download the necessary files
